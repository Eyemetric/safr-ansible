# Seting up FR Servers with Ansible

Ansible is an IT automation tool will ensure one or more machines (physical or virtual) are in particular state after running a script
called a playbook. Before Ansible we were using a "half-assed ad-hoc bash script" to perform the initial setup for an FR server. This worked but required a manual intervention, tweaking and care not to execute multiple times without first performing an uninstall. 
It also suffered from the requirement of having to ssh into each machine one at a time.
